Project Title: Netiquette
Shortcut Tool Extension

Customization option: 
Click effect over the center of the button you accessed with a keyboard shortcut.

KeyWords: 
extension, training, browser, safety

Project Description: 
The purpose of the tool is to train users on how to utilize the shortcuts in their Chromium browser more effectively, and to inform uninformed users about general internet safety.

Services/Functionalities:
- The application would be a Chromium UI extension with the purpose of displaying keyboard shortcuts to users for the specific actions available to them. By displaying the appropriate keyboard shortcut associated with the action the user is completing, they will be able to learn the shortcuts associated with those web actions.
- For example, when hovering the mouse over the “new tab” button on Chrome, the text “Ctrl + T” will appear in a transparent box. When scrolling down on the scroll wheel, the text “Ctrl + Down arrow” will display to the left of the scroll wheel. I would like to extend these tooltips outwards to include an essential set of keyboard shortcuts.
- To expand upon the tool further, it could include best practice tooltips for users to help create a more informed user. For example, when the user selects a password prompt HTML element, the web browser will prompt the user with general advice for creating secure passwords. When hovering over a link, the tool can alert the user they are hovering over an advertisement then warn of the possibility of ads.

Typical Customers: 
Typical users would be anybody trying to improve their speed and efficiency with a computer through knowledge of keyboard shortcuts; business users and organizations may wish to make the extension mandatory to company browsers as a form of employee training.
Middle schools could be interested in the application as a method of passively training students to utilize shortcuts effectively. Learning to navigate a browser quickly is a skill that would make them more effective with computers for the rest of their lives.

Envrionment System:
We anticipate the system being used on Chromium browsers in modern laptop/desktop environments. It will not see use in mobile environments.

Edutopia - Teaching Students about Keyboard Shortcuts
- It is a powerful transferable skill. Since many apps use the same shortcuts, the knowledge often applies across applications. 
- “Learning shortcuts can help students boost their confidence and efficiency navigating online spaces, as well as help them build transferable skills they can apply to different digital environments.”

Development Concerns:
- Identify tools, software and hardware that you anticipate needing for the development of the project. If you will need funding to purchase any software or equipment, estimate the cost.
- There should be no software or hardware requirements for this project. Chrome extensions are written in the same languages as any webpage, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. - - Uploading the extension to the Chrome web store would be free
